The Landlab logo comes in two versions: one has the word and grid (word) and the other has the picture with the word and grid (pic). Each logo comes in either color or black and white (bw). 

The jpg files have white borders around them and are sized for a webpage or other electronic publication. 

The png files have transparent backgrounds, are much larger, and can be easily reduced to desired size. They should be suitable for most needs. 

I tried pdf, eps, and svg versions in vector format, but they did not look as nice as the png. If you need a larger version or different format from what is available here, send an issue or a pull request. 

## Color pallet

Here is the Landlab color pallet to use in illustration and branding:
